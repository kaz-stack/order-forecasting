Time Series Order Forecasting using ARIMA

This project demonstrates **order demand forecasting** for a restaurant using **time series analysis** techniques such as **ARIMA** and **Facebook Prophet**.  
The goal is to predict future order quantities based on historical data trends, seasonality, and residual components using the dummy dataset `the_burger_spot.csv`.  


## Project Workflow  

| Step | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **1. Data Loading** | Loaded the dataset using pandas, parsed dates using `parse_dates=['Date']`, and set the `Date` column as index for time-series analysis. |
| **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** | Checked missing values, visualized trends, and analyzed seasonality and patterns in restaurant orders. |
| **3. Model Building** | Built and compared two forecasting models ‚Äî **ARIMA** (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and **Prophet** (Additive Model by Meta). |
| **4. Model Evaluation** | Evaluated both models using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**. |
| **5. Forecast Visualization** | Visualized actual vs. predicted values with trend lines, confidence intervals, and future projections. |
